# I'm not afraid of MV* in JavaScript

Slides for the talk on [CopenhagenJS in April, 2018](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenjs/events/249032147/).

Responsive web design, Progressive Web Applications, HTML5, CSS3, IDE, API, React, Angular, web components, etc. As developers, we all know what are these words about. But what about more hardcore programming stuff like patterns and classical architectures?

By using frameworks or UI libraries it's easy to forget that JavaScript is a very powerful language to work with. So my goal is to show you that you don't need a framework to build scalable and maintainable applications by providing simple examples of MVC, MVP and MVVM architectures.

## Examples
You can find examples in the `examples` folder.
